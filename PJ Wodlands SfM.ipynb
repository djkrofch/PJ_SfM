    "### Carbon stock determination of a droughted Pinon-Juniper woodland using structure from motion\n",
    "##### Dan J. Krofcheck, Christopher Lippitt, Marcy E. Litvak\n",
    "Low cost photogrammetry projects from either manned or unmanned aircraft can leverage high image overlap to produce 3-dimensional point clouds of surface features, interpolate ground terrain, and gain some crude multi-spectral capabilities such as pseudo-NDVI with the use of makeshift filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we test the ability of SfM data to characterize the distribution of C stocks across a PJ woodland, and subsequently bin the biomass estimates into live and dead carbon pools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis requirements:\n",
    "    1. Use ground measurements and allometries to create a volume to biomass relationship for P and J\n",
    "    2. Perturb this relationship for varying degrees of P mortality\n",
    "    3. Characterize the SfM to ground volume uncertainty\n",
    "    4. propagate uncertainty from P mortality and volume:volume relationship into SfM volume to ground biomass relationship\n",
    "    5. Conduct a segmentation on the SfM data\n",
    "    6. Determine vegetation status (live / dead) using pseudo NDVI for each segment\n",
    "    7. Apply allometry to each segment, if segment is dead, subtract foliar biomass component"
